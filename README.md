# auditData
auditData is a project focused on analyzing ties between tax audit rates, race and income across US counties.  A Shiny app has been developed to visualize asociations.  The tool created as a part of this research is geared toward informing experts in anti-racism and equity non-profits, think tanks and policy positions across the US.  While the datasets used in this project are largely quantitative in nature, the dashboard produced as a part of this research serves as a free and open-source tool to learn more about racial bias in the US tax system for those who donâ€™t necessarily have technical backgrounds.
